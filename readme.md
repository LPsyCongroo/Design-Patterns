# Design Patterns!

Implementations of popular design patterns in JavaScript, Python, and maybe eventually some Java if I can set up a decent workflow for running it in VSCode. 

For the time being, you can run the Javascript files individually in the commandline using `node [filename]` and the python scripts using `python [filename].py`.

### To Do:

* Add Jest for javascript testing instead of console logging
* I'm still new to the language so this might take some research, but add testing for python as well
* Organize the files in a better folder structure.
* Start a blog series on patterns. I want to make sure I have a decent buffer before I publish anything though.
* Figure out a workflow for using Java. It's been years since I've used Java so this is very low on my priority list and I may just focus on JS and Python for now.
